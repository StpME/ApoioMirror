                With rising gentrification across King County and <a href="https://urban.uw.edu/news/gentrification-and-changing-foodscapes-in-seattle/">Seattle in particular</a>,
                more and more people are facing increasing property and rent costs,
                pricing many families and individuals out of the region, with this issue being particularly felt by BIPOC populations.
                Compared to other neighboring counties in King County, King has the highest cost of living as a result of this rapid gentrification.
                These drivers are forcing many small, locally owned businesses to face extreme economic challenges or shut down, 
                consequences that were exacerbated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. A key information technology problem present in this space is the lack of organized information that addresses and provides resources for affordable housing and supporting small businesses using mapping software to focus on these populations most affected by gentrification.
                Other apps that attempt to address certain aspects of this issue are websites like Zillow or Yelp, which provide information on housing and businesses, but neither are adequate for those seeking out small businesses to support or affordable houses in these communities either.
