                With rising gentrification across King County and <a href="https://urban.uw.edu/news/gentrification-and-changing-foodscapes-in-seattle/" target="_blank">Seattle in particular</a>,
                more and more people are facing increasing property and rent costs,
                pricing many families and individuals out of the region, with this issue being particularly felt by BIPOC populations.
                Compared to other neighboring counties in King County, King has the <a href="https://www.census.gov/acs/www/data/data-tables-and-tools/narrative-profiles/2020/report.php?geotype=county&state=53&county=033" target="_blank">highest cost of living</a> as a result of this rapid gentrification.
                These drivers are forcing many small, locally owned businesses to face extreme economic challenges or shut down, 
                consequences that were exacerbated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic.     
            </p>
            <p>
                A key information technology problem present in this space is the lack of organized information that addresses and provides resources for affordable housing and supporting small businesses using mapping software to focus on these populations most affected by gentrification.
                Other apps that attempt to address certain aspects of this issue are websites like <a href="https://www.zillow.com/" target="_blank">Zillow</a> or <a href="https://www.yelp.com/" target="_blank">Yelp</a>, which provide information on housing and businesses, but neither are adequate for those seeking out small businesses to support or finding affordable housing in these communities either. We aim to simplify this process by combining these two processes into one app that focuses on highlighting local or BIPOC-owned businesses in the area so users can support their communities as well as giving the ability to search for places to buy or rent that are affordable as prices continue to become increasingly unsustainable for many communities across the county.

            <p>
                As our web app will be focusing on providing awareness and support for small businesses and marginalized people in the gentrifying city, our users will consist of small business marketing teams, real estate agents advertising affordable housing, and those who are looking to support small businesses or searching for affordable housing.
            </p>
            <p>
                We would like this web app to ultimately give more awareness to the gentrification of the urban parts of King County, we plan to create a map and search figure that lists nearby small businesses and affordable housing. We want to make the site available for both the small businesses and people who are looking for a bite to eat, with accessibility for food similar to Yelp and Google utlizing location services. Because we are focusing on the flaws of King County being the central of many large companies, we would like to help people find affordable housing.
            </p>
            <p>
                For data on our web app, we will be creating a small form database with a few small business so that we can demonstrate the functionality of the web app.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our aim is to simplify the process of accessing information on housing and businesses, especially small and upcoming businesses as existing apps are inadequate for doing so.
