            <p>As our web app will be focusing on providing awareness and support for small businesses and marginalized people in the gentrifying city, our users will consist of small business marketing teams, real estate agents advertising affordable housing, and those who are looking to support small businesses or searching for affordable housing.</p>
            <p>We would like this web app to ultimately give more awareness to the gentrification of the urban parts of King County, we plan to create a map and search figure that lists nearby small businesses and affordable housing. We want to make the site available for both the small businesses and people who are looking for a bite to eat, with accessibility for food similar to Yelp and Google utlizing location services. Because we are focusing on the flaws of King County being the central of many large companies, we would like to help people find affordable housing</p>
